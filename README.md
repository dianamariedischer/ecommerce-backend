## Installation
A user could download or clone this repository, create a .env file with the database name, and their MySQL username/password. They would then have to run the source command for the schema file in the database folder to initialize the database, and then run npm run seed to seed the database. From there they would start up the server (npm run start).    

## Usage
Once the server is running, a user can use an application such as Postman or Insomnia to access the available routes to either read or alter the database. The routes available are GET, POST, PUt, and DELETE, and they can alter, the products, categories, and tags.
